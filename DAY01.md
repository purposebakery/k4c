# Get Started

## Ice breaker

(*5 min*)

(Engage: Who knows and is able to explain what an "Ice breaker" is?)

(Engage: Icebreaker with cajón in middle?)

- Who was born outside of New Zealand?
- Who was born in New Zealand?
- Who likes music?
- Who has a pet animal?
- Who's age is less than all fingers on both hands?
- Who has ever had an injury that required stiches?
- Who has already been on a plane?
- Who has a own smartphone or computer?

(remove cajón)

## Rules

(*5 min*)

(Engage: What's an example for a foundation and why is it important?)

**Rules: A set of 3 DOs and DON'Ts as a foundation for a healthy team**

1. **One person speaks at a time.** Unless we're in a group activity. We do not interrupt. We let everyone finish speaking their thought.
2. **Our respect for one another is untouchable.** We don't laugh about questions (there is nothing like stupid questions there are only knowledge hungry people) / mistakes (he who makes mistakes isn't afraid to show weakness which makes him strong).
3. **We push ourselves to do our very best.** Whatever we do. When things get hard we do not give up. (I prepare properly, even if I have little time. Only 10 more minutes and you're bored. You still try to pay attention. We try to let others go first.)

Is that fair? Questions?

I have a request: If I'm ever too fast or too slow please let me know.

## Day Plan

Our goal is to learn something about computer, especially computer hardware.

1. (*5 min*) A brief overview of computer history 
2. (*10 min*) A brief overview of computer hardware 
3. (*10 min*) We dismantle the PC and identify the parts (keep slide with overview open) 
4. (*20 min*) Hands-on group activity: 3 Groups. 
	- dismantle the laptop without breaking it
	- dismantle the smartphone without breaking it
	- dismantle the harddrive without breaking it

(remember: this is not a race. We want to learn as much as possible. Look, talk, decide, execute) 

5. (*5 min*) We identify the parts of the laptop and smartphone 

## Day Summary
