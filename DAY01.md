# Get Started

## Ice breaker

(*5 min*)

(Engage: Who knows and is able to explain what an "Ice breaker" is?)

- Who was outside of New Zealand?
- Who was born in New Zealand?
- Who likes music?
- Who has a pet animal?
- Who's age is less than all fingers on both hands?
- Who has ever had an injury that required stiches?
- Who has already been on a plane?
- Who has a own smartphone or computer?

## Rules

(*5 min*)

(Engage: What's an example for a foundation and why is it important?)

**Rules: A set of 3 DOs and DON'Ts as a foundation for a healthy team**

1. **One person speaks at a time.** Unless we're in a group activity. We do not interrupt. We let everyone finish speaking their thought.
2. **Our respect for one another is untouchable.** We don't laugh about questions (there is nothing like stupid questions there are only knowledge hungry people) / mistakes (he who makes mistakes isn't afraid to show weakness which makes him strong).
3. **We push ourselves to do our very best.** Whatever we do. When things get hard we do not give up. (I prepare properly, even if I have little time. Only 10 more minutes and you're bored. You still try to pay attention. We try to let others go first.)

Is that fail? Questions?

I have a request: If I'm ever too fast or too slow please let me know.

# Content

## Plan

Our goal is to learn something about computer, especially computer hardware.

1. A brief overview of computer history (*5 min*)
2. A brief overview of computer hardware (*10 min*)
3. We dismantle the PC and identify the parts (keep slide with overview open) (*10 min*)
4. Hands-on group activity: 3 Groups. (*20 min*)
	- dismantle the laptop without breaking it
	- dismantle the smartphone without breaking it
	- dismantle the harddrive without breaking it
(remember: this is not a race. We want to learn as much as possible. Look, Talk, Descide, Execute) 
5. We identify the parts of the laptop and smartphone (*5 min*)

## Day Summary
