# Get Started

## Ice breaker

- Who has a brother or a sister?
- Who enjoys an ice cream every now and then?
- Who hit the drum on the last question?
- Who has brown eyes?
- Who has blue eyes?
- Who has once done something that mom and dad did not like.
- Who thinks this is the last question?

## Rules / Foundation 

1. **One person speaks at a time.** Unless we're in a group activity. We do not interrupt. We let everyone finish speaking their thought.

2. **Respect for one another.** We don't laugh about questions (there is nothing like stupid questions there are only knowledge hungry people) / mistakes (he who makes mistakes isn't afraid to show weakness which makes him strong).

3. **We push ourselves to do our very best.** Whatever we do. When things get hard we do not give up. (I prepare properly, even if I have little time. You still try to pay attention. We try to let others go first.)
